# Unity-3D-Game
An unity 3D game for learning. It's not even halfway completed. It's just another learning project to see what can I do.

Here is what I learned and made with this game :

Changable graphics settings that can be doable with unity's basic settings.
Escape menu only available in the first mission because I forgot to add it to others.
Game includes 40-50 minutes of gameplay. Half of the gameplay is story based which is very bad. Other half is full of mini games that comes with story.
There is a failure option for the minigames and missions so dialogs change in the end.
You choose dialogs in story parts. Some of them changes ending of game. There is 2 ending.
There is energy system which increase if you drink water and decrease when you start mini game.
Like I said its not finished. It just has basic elements which I needed the learn.

Here is the video that shows the little bit gameplay. Sorry for the side bars. It was part of my thesis.
